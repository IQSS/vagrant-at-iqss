"Development environments made easy. Create and configure lightweight, reproducible, and portable development environments." -- http://vagrantup.com

"Using virtual machines running locally on your workstation, Vagrant lets you define the environment your application will run in and quickly iterate on both your application and its environment." -- http://wiki.greptilian.com/vagrant
